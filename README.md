# pytool

This program provides an easy way to set up

 * stand-alone python programs,
 * stand-alone python programs that contain command line accessible
   sub-functions (tool structure), and
 * complete setup.py-based python projects

It used to be part of the
[backscratcher](https://github.com/tbarron/backscratcher) collection.

After the first time you run pytool, you will find a directory of templates
in $HOME/.pytool (you can put this somewhere else by setting PYTOOL_DIR
before running pytool).

Make sure to edit $HOME/.pytool/templates/prjdir/setup.py to set your
author name and e-mail address.
